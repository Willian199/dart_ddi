* Now you can create your own Scopes.

* Break changes:

    * Removed support for `DDIStream`.

## 0.10.1
* Fixed web and wasm support.

## 0.10.0
* Added support to `undo`, `redo` and clear history on events.

* Break changes:
    * If the events isn't registered and `canReplay` is true, the `fire` and `fireWait` methods won't throw EventNotFoundException anymore.
    * All `registerIf` parameters have been renamed to `canRegister`.

* Refactored how `Future` and `FutureOr` is handled.

* Warnings:
    * When registering a Factory Future and trying to obtain more than one instance simultaneously, it may cause a race condition and will be blocked. Especially if the instance is Application Scope.
    * When using Interceptors and Factories, you must register your Factory with `ddi.register(factory: ApplicationFactory(builder: ..., interceptors: [...]))`

* Break changes:
    * `DDIInterceptor.aroundConstruct` renamed to `DDIInterceptor.onCreate`.
    * `DDIInterceptor.aroundGet` renamed to `DDIInterceptor.onGet`.
