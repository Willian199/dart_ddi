# Core Concepts
## Scopes

The Dart Dependency Injection (DDI) package supports various scopes for efficient management of object instances. Each scope determines how instances are created, reused, and destroyed throughout the application lifecycle. Below are detailed characteristics of each scope, along with recommendations, use cases, and considerations for potential issues.

## Singleton
`Description`: This scope creates an unique instance during registration and reuses it in all subsequent requests.

`Recommendation`: Suitable for objects that need to be globally shared across the application, maintaining a single instance.

`Use Case`: Sharing a configuration manager, a logging service, or a global state manager.

`Note`: 

 * `Interceptor.onDipose` and `PreDispose` mixin are not supported. You can just destroy the instance. 

 * If you call dispose, only the Application or Session childrens will be disposed.      

## Application
`Description`: Generates an instance when first used and reuses it for all subsequent requests during the application's execution.

`Recommendation`: Indicated for objects that need to be created only once per application and shared across different parts of the code.

`Use Case`: Managing application-level resources, such as a network client or a global configuration.

`Note`: `PreDispose` and `PreDestroy` mixins will only be called if the instance is in use. Use `Interceptor` if you want to call them regardless.

## Session
`Description`: Ties an instance to a specific session, persisting throughout the session's lifespan.

`Recommendation`: Suitable for objects that need to be retained while a session is active, such as user-specific data or state.

`Use Case`: Managing user authentication state or caching user-specific preferences.

`Note`: `PreDispose` and `PreDestroy` mixins will only be called if the instance is in use. Use `Interceptor` if you want to call them regardless.

## Dependent
`Description`: Produces a new instance every time it is requested, ensuring independence and uniqueness.

`Recommendation`: Useful for objects that should remain independent and different in each context or request.

`Use Case`: Creating instances of transient objects like data repositories or request handlers.

`Note`:

 * `Dispose` functions, `Interceptor.onDipose` and `PreDispose` mixin are not supported.

 * `PreDestroy` mixins are not supported. Use `Interceptor.onDestroy` instead. 

## Object
`Description`: Registers an Object in the Object Scope, ensuring it is created once and shared throughout the entire application, working like Singleton.

`Recommendation`: Suitable for objects that are stateless or have shared state across the entire application.

`Use Case`: Application or device properties, like platform or dark mode settings, where the object's state needs to be consistent across the entire application.

`Note`:

 * `Interceptor.onDipose` and `PreDispose` mixin are not supported. You can just destroy the instance.

 * If you call dispose, only the Application or Session childrens will be disposed.

## Common Considerations:
`Unique Registration`: Ensure that the instance to be registered is unique for a specific type or use qualifiers to enable the registration of multiple instances of the same type.

`Memory Management`: Be aware of memory implications for long-lived objects, especially in the Singleton and Object scopes.

`Nested Instances`: Avoid unintentional coupling by carefully managing instances within larger-scoped objects.

`const and Modifiers`: Take into account the impact of const and other class modifiers on the behavior of instances within different scopes.

# Factories

Encapsulate the instantiation logic, providing a better way to define how and when objects are created. They use a builder function to manage the creation process, providing flexibility and control over the instances.

## How Factories Work

When you register a factory, you provide a builder function that defines how the instance will be constructed. This builder can take parameters, enabling the factory to customize the creation process based on the specific needs of the application. Depending on the specified scope (e.g., singleton or application), the factory can either create a new instance each time it is requested or return the same instance for subsequent requests.

#### Example Registration

```dart
MyService.new.builder.asApplication().register();
```

In this example:

* `MyService.new.` is the default constructor of the class (e.g., `() => MyService()`). 
* `.builder` defines the parameters for the instance of `MyService`.
* `.asApplication()` define the scope of the factory to create a new instance of `MyService` only on the first request.
* `.register()` finalizes the factory registration in the `dart_ddi` system.

## Use Cases for Factories

#### Asynchronous Creation
Factories support asynchronous creation, which is useful when initialization requires asynchronous tasks, such as data fetching.

```dart
DDI.instance.register(
  factory: ScopeFactory.application(
    builder: () async {
      final data = await getApiData();
      return MyApiService(data);
    }.builder,
  ),
);
```

### Custom Parameters
Factories can define parameters for builders, allowing for more flexible object creation based on runtime conditions. This also enables automatic injection of `Beans` into factories.

```dart
// Registering the factory
DDI.instance.register(
  factory: ScopeFactory.application(
    builder: (RecordParameter parameter) { 
      return ServiceWithParameter(parameter);
    }.builder,
  ),
);

DDI.instance.register(
  factory: ScopeFactory.application(
    builder: (MyDatabase database, UserService userService) {
      return ServiceAutoInject(database, userService);
    }.builder,
  ),
);

// Retrieving the instances
ddi.getWith<ServiceWithParameter, RecordParameter>(parameter: parameter);
ddi.get<ServiceAutoInject>();
```
## Considerations

`Object Scope:` The Object Scope is not supported for factories.

`Singleton Scope:` The Singleton Scope can only be created with auto-inject. If you attempt to create a singleton with custom objects, a `BeanNotFoundException` will be thrown.

`Supertypes or Interfaces:` You cannot use the shortcut builder (`MyService.new.builder.asApplication()`) with supertypes or interfaces. This limitation exists because the builder function only recognizes the implementation class, not the supertype or interface.

`Decorators and Interceptors:` It is highly recommended to register the factory using `factory: ScopeFactory.scope(...)`. This approach handles type inference more effectively.

`Lazy vs. Eager Injection:` Eager Injection occurs when you inject beans using auto-inject functionality or manually via constructors. For lazy injection, you can use the `DDIInject` mixin or define the variable as `late`(e.g., `late final ServiceAutoInject serviceAutoInject = ddi.get()`).

# Qualifiers

Qualifiers are used to differentiate instances of the same type, enabling to identify and retrieve specific instances. In scenarios where multiple instances coexist, qualifiers serve as optional labels or identifiers associated with the registration and retrieval of instances.

## How Qualifiers Work
When registering an instance, can provide a qualifier as part of the registration process. This qualifier acts as metadata associated with the instance and can later be used during retrieval to specify which instance is needed.

#### Example Registration with Qualifier

```dart
ddi.registerSingleton<MyService>(MyService.new, qualifier: "specialInstance");
```

## Retrieval with Qualifiers
During retrieval, if multiple instances of the same type exist, can use the associated qualifier to specify the desired instance. But remember, if you register using qualifier, should retrieve with qualifier.

####  Example Retrieval with Qualifier

```dart
MyService specialInstance = ddi.get<MyService>(qualifier: "specialInstance");
```
## Use Cases for Qualifiers

#### Configuration Variations

When there are multiple configurations for a service, such as different API endpoints or connection settings.
```dart
ddi.registerSingleton<ApiService>(() => ApiService("endpointA"), qualifier: "endpointA");
ddi.registerSingleton<ApiService>(() => ApiService("endpointB"), qualifier: "endpointB");
```

#### Feature Flags

When different instances are required based on feature flags or runtime conditions.
```dart
ddi.registerSingleton<FeatureService>(() => FeatureService(enabled: true), qualifier: "enabled");
ddi.registerSingleton<FeatureService>(() => FeatureService(enabled: false), qualifier: "disabled");
```

#### Platform-Specific Implementations

In scenarios where platform-specific implementations are required, such as different services for Android and iOS, qualifiers can be employed to distinguish between the platform-specific instances.

```dart
ddi.registerSingleton<PlatformService>(AndroidService.new, qualifier: "android");
ddi.registerSingleton<PlatformService>(iOSService.new, qualifier: "ios");
```

## Considerations

`Consistent Usage:` Maintain consistent usage of qualifiers throughout the codebase to ensure clarity and avoid confusion.

`Avoid Overuse:` While qualifiers offer powerful customization, avoid overusing them to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

`Type Identifiers:` Qualifiers are often implemented using string-based identifiers, which may introduce issues such as typos or potential naming conflicts. To mitigate these concerns, it is highly recommended to utilize enums or constants.

# Extra Customization
The DDI package provides features for customizing the lifecycle of registered instances. These features include `postConstruct`, `decorators`, `interceptor`, `canRegister` and `canDestroy`.

## PostConstruct
The `postConstruct` callback allows to perform additional setup or initialization after an instance is created. This is particularly useful for executing logic that should run once the instance is ready for use.

#### Example Usage:
```dart
ddi.registerSingleton<MyService>(
  MyService.new,
  postConstruct: () {
    // Additional setup logic after MyService instance creation.
    print("MyService instance is ready!");
  },
);
```

## Decorators
Decorators provide a way to modify or enhance the behavior of an instance before it is returned. Each decorator is a function that takes the existing instance and returns a modified instance. Multiple decorators can be applied, and they are executed in the order they are specified during registration.

#### Example Usage:
```dart

class ModifiedMyService extends MyService {
  ModifiedMyService(MyService instance) {
    super.value = 'new value';
  }
}

ddi.registerSingleton<MyService>(
  MyService.new,
  decorators: [
    (existingInstance) => ModifiedMyService(existingInstance),
    // Additional decorators can be added as needed.
  ],
);
```

## Interceptor
The Interceptor provides control over the instantiation, retrieval, destruction, and disposal of instances managed by the DDI package. By creating a custom class that extends `DDIInterceptor`, you can inject custom logic at various stages of the instance's lifecycle.

## Interceptor Methods

### onCreate
- Invoked after instance creation and before Decorators and PostConstruct mixin.
- Execute custom logic, Customize or replace the instance by returning a modified instance.

### onGet
- Invoked when retrieving an instance.
- Customize the behavior of the retrieved instance before it is returned.
- If you change any value, the next time you get this instance, it will be applied again. Be aware that this can lead to unexpected behavior.

### onDestroy
- Invoked when an instance is being destroyed.
- Allows customization of the instance destruction process.

### onDispose
- Invoked during the disposal of an instance.
- Provides an opportunity for customization before releasing resources or performing cleanup.

#### Example Usage

 ```dart
 class CustomInterceptor<BeanT> extends DDIInterceptor<BeanT> {
   @override
   BeanT onCreate(BeanT instance) {
     // Logic to customize or replace instance creation.
     return CustomizedInstance();
   }

   @override
   BeanT onGet(BeanT instance) {
     // Logic to customize the behavior of the retrieved instance.
     return ModifiedInstance(instance);
   }

   @override
   void onDestroy(BeanT instance) {
     // Logic to perform cleanup during instance destruction.
     // This method is optional and can be overridden as needed.
   }

   @override
   void onDispose(BeanT instance) {
     // Logic to release resources or perform custom cleanup during instance disposal.
     // This method is optional and can be overridden as needed.
   }
 }
 ```

## CanRegister
The canRegister parameter is a boolean function that determines whether an instance should be registered. It provides conditional registration based on a specified condition. This is particularly useful for ensuring that only a single instance is registered, preventing issues with duplicated instances.

#### Example Usage:
```dart
ddi.registerSingleton<MyService>(
  MyServiceAndroid.new,
  canRegister: () {
    return Platform.isAndroid && MyUserService.isAdmin();
  },
);
ddi.registerSingleton<MyService>(
  MyServiceIos.new,
  canRegister: () {
    return Platform.isIOS && MyUserService.isAdmin();
  },
);
ddi.registerSingleton<MyService>(
  MyServiceDefault.new,
  canRegister: () {
    return !MyUserService.isAdmin();
  },
);
```

## CanDestroy 
The canDestroy parameter, is optional and can be set to false if you want to make the registered instance indestructible. When set to false, the instance cannot be removed using the `destroy` or `destroyByType` methods.

#### Example Usage:
```dart
// Register an Application instance that is indestructible
ddi.registerApplication<MyService>(
  MyService.new,
  canDestroy: false,
);
```

## Selector
The `selector` parameter allows for conditional selection when retrieving an instance, providing a way to determine which instance should be used based on specific criteria. The first instance that matches `true` will be selected; if no instance matches, a `BeanNotFoundException` will be thrown. The selector requires registration with an interface type, making it particularly useful in scenarios where multiple instances of the same type are registered, but only one needs to be chosen dynamically at runtime based on context.`

#### Example Usage:
```dart
void main() {

   // Registering CreditCardPaymentService with a selector condition
  ddi.registerApplication<PaymentService>(
    CreditCardPaymentService.new,
    qualifier: 'creditCard',
    selector: (paymentMethod) => paymentMethod == 'creditCard',
  );

  // Registering PayPalPaymentService with a selector condition
  ddi.registerApplication<PaymentService>(
    PayPalPaymentService.new,
    qualifier: 'paypal',
    selector: (paymentMethod) => paymentMethod == 'paypal',
  );

  // Runtime value to determine the payment method
  const selectedPaymentMethod = 'paypal'; // Could also be 'creditCard'

  // Retrieve the appropriate PaymentService based on the selector condition
  late final paymentService = ddi.get<PaymentService>(
    select: selectedPaymentMethod,
  );

  // Process a payment with the selected service
  paymentService.processPayment(100.0);
}
```

## Modules

Modules offer a convenient way to modularize and organize dependency injection configuration in your application. Through the use of the `addChildModules` and `addChildrenModules` methods, you can add and configure specific modules, grouping related dependencies and facilitating management of your dependency injection container.

When you execute `dispose` or `destroy` for a module, they will be executed for all its children.

### Adding a Class

To add a single class to a module to your dependency injection container, you can use the `addChildModules` method.

- `child`: This refers to the type or qualifier of the subclasses that will be part of the module. Note that these are not instances, but rather types or qualifiers.
- `qualifier` (optional): This parameter refers to the main class type of the module. It is optional and is used as a qualifier if needed.

```dart
// Adding a single module with an optional specific qualifier.
ddi.addChildModules<MyModule>(
  child: MySubmoduleType, 
  qualifier: 'MyModule',
);
```

### Adding Multiple Class
To add multiple class to a module at once, you can utilize the `addChildrenModules` method.

- `child`: This refers to the type or qualifier of the subclasses that will be part of the module. Note that these are not instances, but rather types or qualifiers.
- `qualifier` (optional): This parameter refers to the main class type of the module. It is optional and is used as a qualifier if needed.

```dart
// Adding multiple modules at once.
ddi.addChildrenModules<MyModule>(
  child: [MySubmoduleType1, MySubmoduleType2], 
  qualifier: 'MyModule',
);
```
With these methods, you can modularize your dependency injection configuration, which can be especially useful in larger applications with complex instance management requirements.

### Register With Children Parameter

The `children` parameter is designed to receive types or qualifiers. This parameter allows you to register multiple classes under a single parent module.

```dart
// Adding multiple modules at once.
ddi.registerApplication<ParentModule>(
  () => ParentModule(),
  children: [
    ChildModule,
    OtherModule,
    'ChildModuleQualifier',
    'OtherModuleQualifier'
  ],
);
```

## Mixins

### Post Construct Mixin

The `PostConstruct` mixin has been added to provide the ability to execute specific rules after the construction of an instance of the class using it. Its primary purpose is to offer an extension point for additional logic that needs to be executed immediately after an object is created.

By including the PostConstruct mixin in a class and implementing the `onPostConstruct()` method, you can ensure that this custom logic is automatically executed right after the instantiation of the class.

#### Example Usage:
```dart
class MyClass with PostConstruct {
  final String name;

  MyClass(this.name);

  @override
  void onPostConstruct() {
    // Custom logic to be executed after construction.
    print('Instance of MyClass has been successfully constructed.');
    print('Name: $_name');
  }
}
```

### Pre Destroy Mixin

The `PreDestroy` mixin has been created to provide a mechanism for executing specific actions just before an object is destroyed. This mixin serves as a counterpart to the PostConstruct mixin, allowing to define custom cleanup logic that needs to be performed before an object's lifecycle ends.

#### Example Usage:
```dart
class MyClass with PreDestroy {
  final String name;

  MyClass(this.name);

  @override
  void onPreDestroy() {
    // Custom cleanup logic to be executed before destruction.
    print('Instance of MyClass is about to be destroyed.');
    print('Performing cleanup for $name');
  }
}

void main() {
  // Registering an instance of MyClass
  ddi.registerSingleton<MyClass>(
     () => MyClass('Willian'),
  );
  
  // Destroying the instance (removing it from the container).
  ddi.remove<MyClass>();
  
  // Output:
  // Instance of MyClass is about to be destroyed.
  // Performing cleanup for Willian
}
```

### Pre Dispose Mixin

The `PreDispose` mixin extends the lifecycle management capabilities, allowing custom logic to be executed before an instance is disposed.

#### Example Usage:
```dart
class MyClass with PreDispose {
  final String name;

  MyClass(this.name);

  @override
  void onPreDispose() {
    // Custom cleanup logic to be executed before disposal.
    print('Instance of MyClass is about to be disposed.');
    print('Performing cleanup for $name');
  }
}
```

### DDIModule Mixin

The `DDIModule` mixin provides a convenient way to organize and manage your dependency injection configuration within your Dart application. By implementing this mixin in your module classes, you can easily register instances with different scopes and dependencies using the provided methods.

#### Example Usage:

```dart
// Define a module using the DDIModule mixin

class AppModule with DDIModule {
  @override
  void onPostConstruct() {
    // Registering instances with different scopes
    registerSingleton(() => Database('main_database'), qualifier: 'mainDatabase');
    registerApplication(() => Logger(), qualifier: 'appLogger');
    registerObject('https://api.example.com', qualifier: 'apiUrl');
    registerDependent(() => ApiService(inject.get(qualifier: 'apiUrl')), qualifier: 'dependentApiService');
  }
}
```

### `DDIInject`, `DDIInjectAsync` and `DDIComponentInject` Mixins

The `DDIInject`, `DDIInjectAsync` and `DDIComponentInject` mixins are designed to facilitate dependency injection of an instance into your classes. They provide a convenient method to obtain an instance of a specific type from the dependency injection container.

The `DDIInject` mixin allows for synchronous injection of an instance and `DDIInjectAsync` mixin allows for asynchronous injection. Both defines a `instance` property that will be initialized with the `InjectType` instance obtained.

The `DDIComponentInject` allows injecting a specific instance using a module as a selector.

#### Example Usage:
```dart
class MyController with DDIInject<MyService> {
  void businessLogic() {
    instance.runSomething();
  }
}

class MyAsyncController with DDIInjectAsync<MyService> {
  Future<void> businessLogic() async {
    final myInstance = await instance;
    myInstance.runSomething();
  }

class MyController with DDIComponentInject<MyComponent, MyModule> {

  void businessLogic() {
    instance.runSomething();
  }
}
```
